Magic Canvas

Magic Canvas is a creative web application that allows users to work on the same canvas but instead of using pencils and brushes using words and commands that the application reads into lines, pictures and words on the canvas.
Every user has its own list of executed commands but has access to the world-made canvas.

Commands:

'circle' or 'rectangle' + color to draw shapes.
Any other text to write it behind.
The "magic command"

EX:

 - green rectangle
 - rect blue
 - black circle
 - yellow
 - circ
 - Marc and Sandra create this!
 - I can write whatever I like


And if you type % something special will happen... try it yourself!
